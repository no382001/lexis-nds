- if some of the words have the same form, just list the possible ones, dont show each word again and again - i think this is already done in the normalization step, but double check - its not

[x] add stats after the flatdb generation about the amount of words that dont have definitions
[x] enable all warnings -Werror too

[x] there should be a way to fast-track to Hom.Il.5.15 or something so i will need a keyboard, and i can use this to add custom entries for words - partially done - i will still need a kb

[~] look at nitrous tracker a bit more, their ui-s look to be hand crafted, they look very good - looks better - but a 16 bit diacritical greek font would look better. pillow render is fine for now

[~] rethink the renderer, its snappy sometimes i can see the scanlines, idk if they are laggy just in the simulation, but a flowing kind of scrolling is what i want to go for - render to the bg? also use glyphs and 16 bit diacritic greek font?

- think about modularity, most things should be generated , right now the iliad is the only target, but the system should be ready, c11 has static asserts, and get rid of all magic numbers

[x] multiple files, some files are getting too big, hacked together code with few patterns

[x] eventually i will want to draw, how do i compact that?
- there should be a lasso tool that removes the drawings that it hits

- maybe a spashscreen of a scan of the iliad

- i will never need it but put reserved space in the sav file

[x] add clang format

- version number, title and info about the rom should be in a yaml file, added to the makefile upon building, and compiled into the info parts of the program
like:
    rom_title: Reader v0.0.1 (dev)
    corpus: Homer, Iliad
    annotation: Hom. Il.

- experiment with non-snap scrolling, add a way to scroll much faster, maybe remap the bumpers for this

- a virtual layer that i can test on real hardware easier, load up the loader-rom, select a file from the ftp server, load that into memory, when the loaded rom exits you get back into the virtual layer

- save does not seem to work on target hardware, i should add a logs tab in setting, ndsfetch could push the latest logs to the httpserver
